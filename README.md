# Python_stuff
I'm learning some python little by little, so I'll add different little py files in this repo to track progress.

Make sure you have python 3.7+ on your os and make sure you have the path set up correctly to run commands from the terminal


## Baby maker
Run python babymaker_2.py in your terminal it will prompt to choose 1 of three options for six letters to create baby names!

## webMapApp
open the index html file in a browser ;]

## dataScrubber 
Just a system of data scrubbing/cleansing a type of txt file. scrubbit falls under this catagory as well

## dragonGame
Game that takes you to the world of dragons!

## website blocker
Named after what it does, meant to keep me productive at work and block distracting websites from being available from 9-5
